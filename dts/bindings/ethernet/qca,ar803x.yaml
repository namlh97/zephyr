    type: int
    description: Clock output frequency in Hertz.
    enum: [25000000, 50000000, 62500000, 125000000]

  qca,disable-smarteee:
    type: boolean
    description: Disable Atheros SmartEEE feature.


  qca,keep-pll-enabled:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      If set, keep the PLL enabled even if there is no link. Useful if you
      want to use the clock output without an ethernet link.
      Only supported on the AR8031.

  qca,disable-hibernation-mode:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      Disable Atheros AR803X PHYs hibernation mode. If present, indicates
      that the hardware of PHY will not enter power saving mode when the
      cable is disconnected. And the RX_CLK always keeps outputting a
      valid clock.

  vddio-supply:
    type: phandle
    description: |
      RGMII I/O voltage regulator (see regulator/regulator.yaml).

      The PHY supports RGMII I/O voltages of 1.5V, 1.8V and 2.5V. You can
      either connect this to the vddio-regulator (1.5V / 1.8V) or the
      vddh-regulator (2.5V).

      Only supported on the AR8031.

    type: phandle-array
    description: GPIO connected to PHY reset signal pin. Reset is active low.

  int-gpios:
    type: phandle-array
    description: GPIO for interrupt signal indicating PHY state change.
