properties:
  ti,min-output-impedance:
    type: boolean
    description: |
       MAC Interface Impedance control to set the programmable output impedance
       to a minimum value (35 ohms).

  ti,max-output-impedance:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      MAC Interface Impedance control to set the programmable output impedance
      to a maximum value (70 ohms).
      Note: ti,min-output-impedance and ti,max-output-impedance are mutually
        exclusive. When both properties are present ti,max-output-impedance
        takes precedence.

  tx-fifo-depth:
    type: int
    description: |
       Transmitt FIFO depth see dt-bindings/net/ti-dp83867.h for values

  rx-fifo-depth:
    type: int
    description: |
       Receive FIFO depth see dt-bindings/net/ti-dp83867.h for values

  ti,clk-output-sel:
    type: int
    description: |
      Muxing option for CLK_OUT pin.  See dt-bindings/net/ti-dp83867.h
      for applicable values. The CLK_OUT pin can also be disabled by this
      property.  When omitted, the PHY's default will be left as is.

  ti,rx-internal-delay:
    type: int
    description: |
      RGMII Receive Clock Delay - see dt-bindings/net/ti-dp83867.h
      for applicable values. Required only if interface type is
      PHY_INTERFACE_MODE_RGMII_ID or PHY_INTERFACE_MODE_RGMII_RXID.

  ti,tx-internal-delay:
    type: int
    description: |
      RGMII Transmit Clock Delay - see dt-bindings/net/ti-dp83867.h
      for applicable values. Required only if interface type is
      PHY_INTERFACE_MODE_RGMII_ID or PHY_INTERFACE_MODE_RGMII_TXID.

        Note: If the interface type is PHY_INTERFACE_MODE_RGMII the TX/RX clock
          delays will be left at their default values, as set by the PHY's pin
          strapping. The default strapping will use a delay of 2.00 ns.  Thus
          PHY_INTERFACE_MODE_RGMII, by default, does not behave as RGMII with no
          internal delay, but as PHY_INTERFACE_MODE_RGMII_ID.  The device tree
          should use "rgmii-id" if internal delays are desired as this may be
          changed in future to cause "rgmii" mode to disable delays.

  ti,dp83867-rxctrl-strap-quirk:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      This denotes the fact that the board has RX_DV/RX_CTRL pin strapped in
      mode 1 or 2. To ensure PHY operation, there are specific actions that
      software needs to take when this pin is strapped in these modes.
      See data manual for details.

  ti,sgmii-ref-clock-output-enable:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      This denotes which SGMII configuration is used (4 or 6-wire modes).
      Some MACs work with differential SGMII clock. See data manual for details.

  ti,fifo-depth:
    type: int
    description: |
      Transmitt FIFO depth- see dt-bindings/net/ti-dp83867.h for applicable
      values.

  ti,enet-phy-lane-swap:
      type: boolean
      description: |
        If set, indicates the PHY will swap the TX/RX lanes to
        compensate for the board being designed with the lanes swapped.

  ti,enet-phy-lane-no-swap:
      type: boolean
      description: |
        If set, indicates that PHY will disable swap of the
        TX/RX lanes. This property allows the PHY to work correcly after e.g. 
        wrong bootstrap configuration caused by issues in PCB layout design.

  ti,led0-active-low:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      This denotes that the LED_0 pin should be driven as active low.

  ti,led1-active-low:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      This denotes that the LED_1 pin should be driven as active low.

  ti,led2-active-low:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      This denotes that the LED_2 pin should be driven as active low.

  ti,reset-gpio:
    type: phandle-array
    specifier-space: gpio
    description: GPIO connected to PHY reset signal pin. Reset is active low.

  ti,interrupt-gpio:
    type: phandle-array
    specifier-space: gpio
    description: GPIO for interrupt signal indicating PHY state change.

  ti,interface-type:
    type: string
    required: true
    description: Which type of phy connection the phy is set up for
    enum:
      - "mii"
      - "rmii"
      - "rgmii"
      - "rgmii-id"
